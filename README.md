This application combines different technologies like react native, expo, firebase, redux and more. And the idea behind this application is to make an Instagram clone from scratch.

The technologies used in this project are:

1-. Expo, the advantages of the use of expo are:

- Fast and simple to install.
- Android studio/xCode are not needed.
- Hot updates to deployed apps.
- Developer friendly.
- Simpler project structure.

The web page is expo.io 

previous to install expo we need previously installed 
NodeJs and npm. After that we can start with the installation.

npm install --global expo-cli
expo init my-app
expo init my-app -t "blank"
cd my-app
expo start

The commands above are in order, and for install expo we 
need the git command line.

Between the commit 1 until the commit 6 is part project called auth system 
with firebase and react native.
